# Project: AI Agent Hosting with LangGraph and VLLM

## Overview
This project involves hosting the Qwen3-14B model to create an AI agent using LangGraph and VLLM. The goal is to leverage the power of Qwen3-14B for advanced reasoning and problem-solving tasks.

## Key Components
- **Qwen3-14B Model**: A state-of-the-art language model used for generating human-like text responses.
- **LangGraph**: A framework for building and managing complex workflows for AI models.
- **VLLM**: A library for efficient model inference and serving.
- **Qdrant**: A free vector database for retrieval tool.

## Features
- Seamless integration of Qwen3-14B with LangGraph for structured reasoning.
- Utilization of VLLM for optimized model serving and inference.
- Scalable and efficient AI agent deployment.
